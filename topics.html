                    <p>Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air—pollutants that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year air pollution is responsible for nearly seven million deaths around the globe. Nine out of ten human beings currently breathe air that exceeds the WHO’s guideline limits for pollutants, with those living in low- and middle-income countries suffering the most. In the United States, the Clean Air Act, established in 1970, authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to safeguard public health by regulating the emissions of these harmful air pollutants.

Though the climate crisis is a human rights issue, a whole-of-government approach is still needed to address ongoing problems left behind by limited relief packages, slow responses from authorities, and excessive waste.

                    <p>Widespread improvements in the quality of life of many of the world’s populations have gone hand-in-hand with increased demands on natural resources. The planet is struggling to keep up, with increases in the average global temperature and the frequency of extreme weather events transforming ecosystems around the world and threatening entire species of plants and animals. Forests are drying up, there is less rainfall and more fires, and the glaciers of both the North and South Poles are shrinking. The consequences of climate change affect all of us, but in order to react and adapt to it, we must first understand it.</p>
